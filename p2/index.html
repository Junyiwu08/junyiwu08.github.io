        <p>It’s a place for coffee shops, roasters and industry people to showcase their brand experience for 1-3 days. Different shops, roasters, coffee manufacturers will rotate thru and serve coffee at an elevated/new concept experience that’s a departure from the traditional cafe. Shops will have the opportunity to present coffee with any process and format including but not limited to workshops, training, coffee tastings or just a simple espresso bar. The goal is to explore a coffee dialogue thru the diverse network of coffee shops and coffee professionals.</p>
        <h2>“I’d like to be a part of something with a bit of soul. I really want to know about the people I’m serving, what makes them tick.”</h2>
        <p>The Pop-up will allow shops to present coffee that’s not confined to regional consumer demands but rather allow for both a laboratory for discovery and experimental experiences for the visitor. Over the period of 2 months, the guideline is to simply serve coffee as you choose to define it, espresso bar, cupping lab, drip bar, single brew, cold brew, coffee tasting and training, etc.</p>
