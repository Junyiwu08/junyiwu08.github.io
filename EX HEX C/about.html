            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>In the 19th century, different country’s women face the same problem which is they cannot get equal rights with man. Through the development of social, the woman realizes that we need to take action to protect themselves. Therefore, Feminism appears in the world. As we know, the feminist movement (also known as the women's movement, or simply feminism) refers to a series of political campaigns for reforms on issues such as reproductive rights, domestic violence, maternity leave, equal pay, women's suffrage, sexual harassment, and sexual violence, all of which fall under the label of feminism and the feminist movement. 
The women’s movement became more popular in May 1968. </p>

            The Underground feminist band is a subcultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk style and politics. It is often associated with third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as having grown out of the Riot Grrrl movement. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.

The Underground feminist Bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, and female empowerment. Primary bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Skinned Teen, Emily's Sassy Lime, and Sleater-Kinney, as well as queercore groups like Team Dresch and The Third Sex. In addition to a music scene and genre, it is a subculture involving a DIY ethic, zines, art, political action, and activism. This music movement quickly spread well beyond its musical roots to create vibrant “zine” and World Wide Web-based movement, complete with local meetings and grassroots organizing to end ageism, homophobia, weightism, racism, sexism and, especially, physical and emotional violence against women and girls.

Men can be feminist allies, because yes, feminism is for everybody. Also, men can be part of the movement for gender equality.
