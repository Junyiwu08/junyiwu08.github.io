            <h1>The basic definition of desktop icon and big data</h1>
            <p>
            The basic definition of desktop icon: Basic definition in computer: In computing, desktop icon is a pictogram or ideogram displayed on a computer screen in order to help the user navigate a computer system. Provide the services for user. Also, desktop icon is meaningful to people. In these days of gargantuan hard drives and labyrinthine networks, it's easy to lose your place in a complex hierarchy of folders. You need desktop icon to find them fast and remember them.
            </p>
            <p>The basic definition of big data: Big data is a term used to refer to data sets that are too large or complex for traditional data-processing application software to adequately deal with. Also it is extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions. (Big data is a term that describes the large volume of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. But it’s not the amount of data that’s important. It’s what organizations do with the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves.)</p>

            <h1>The function and elements of desktop icon</h1>
            <p>Function: The desktop icon itself is a quickly comprehensible symbol of a software tool, function, or a data file, accessible on the system and is more like a traffic sign than a detailed illustration of the actual entity it represents. It can serve as an electronic hyperlink or file shortcut to access the program or data.</p>
            <p>Elements: Desktop icons are designed to be simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, expressing essential characteristics. First one is Shape which include Key-line Shapes and basic shapes; Second is desktop icon layout; Third is desktop icon’s color.</p>

Interactive Visual Analytics of Big Data : A Web‐Based Approach;</h2>
            <p>Introduction: Data is being generated and collected by companies, organizations, public sectors,  etc. in unprecedented pace and quantities – and the pace and quantity is expected  to only increase in coming years (Manyika, Chui et al. 2011). However, in order to  facilitate exploratory analysis these immense amounts of data, often characterized  as  Big  Data,  the  data  must  be  made  available  and  apprehensible  for  domain  experts,  as  well  as  private  users,  who  commonly  are  not  programmers.  Information  visualization  and  visual  analytics  has  the  potential  for making  data  available and apprehensible for users in many different application domains (Card,  Mackinlay et al. 1999). Extending on this, the web has shown an unprecedented  ability  to  converge media and  technologies  into a  single,  open‐ended  platform.  With  the  emergence  of  standardized  web  technologies  for  creating  rich  visualization with sophisticated interactions, the web also has great potential to  integrate  exploratory  visual  analytics  of  big  data  in  browsers.  Facilitating exploratory  visual  analytics  of  big  data  in  browsers  is  a  momentous  challenge because  it  has  the  potential  to  endow  a  large  group  of  users  with  access  to  apprehensible data visual analytics tools. Users such as domain experts who can  benefit from being able to visually analyze data to do data driven decision making,  or private users who have a personal interest in e.g. open data for institutional or  governmental transparency. However, enabling exploratory visual analytics of big  data in  browsers is a grand challenge because browsers exist on a multitude of device types with different performance and interaction capabilities.</p>
            <p>Research Objectives
            Recent  years  has  seen  advancements  in  the  abilities  for  developing  advanced  interactive visual analytics tools in browsers. Standardized web technologies such  as  Scalable  Vector  Graphics  (SVG)  (Dahlstrøm,  Dengler  et  al.  2011)  have  been utilized  to  create  advanced  JavaScript  libraries  for  creating  interactive  visualizations  in  browsers,  including  D3  (Bostock,  Ogievetsky  et  al.  2011)  and  Reactive  Vega  (Satyanarayan,  Russell  et  al.  2016).  Furthermore,  web‐browser  capabilities  are  developing  rapidly  by  third  party  JavaScript  libraries  in  general,  such  as  JQMultiTouch  (Nebeling  and  Norrie),  which  facilitates  creating  sophisticated multitouch interactions in browsers on touch‐enabled devices.  My  research  objectives  take advantage  of existing  technologies and capabilities  available in web browsers to provide novel exploratory big data visual analytics in  browsers for non‐programmer domain experts and private users. In my work I have  adopted a three‐pronged approach: </p>
            <p>1.To enable domain experts with low experience with visual analysis to do  data  driven  decision  making,  I  engage  with  end  users  to  develop visualization  techniques  with  high  apprehensibility  to  facilitate  domain  experts  to  leverage  their  contextual  expertise  when  performing  visual  analysis. Furthermore, dissemination of web‐based visual analytics  tools  to domain experts and private users alike also requires the availability of  applying them to datasets that users wishes to analyze.   
            2.Creating and rendering interactive visualizations of large datasets in web-browsers requires detailed understanding of performance –especially true  for  declarative  SVG  visualizations.  Therefore,  techniques  for  retaining  responsiveness  is  essential  for  facilitating  web‐based  exploratory  visual  analytics of big data.   
                3. Developing  web‐based  visual  analytics  tools  for  domain  experts  and  private users means that these tool will be used on devices familiar to such  users.  Particularly  direct‐touch  enabled  multitouch  devices,  which  have  high  commercial  penetration  (eMarketer)  and  has  been  of  increasing  research  interest  in  recent  years  (Schmidt  2015).  This  means  that fluid touch interaction  techniques with a low barrier of entry are needed  for  domain experts and private users untrained in visual data analysis. </p>

        <p>Go through the definition of big data, discuss the function of big data : To really understand big data, Big data is data that contains greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity. Put simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just can’t manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.</p>
        <h1>Function of big data:  Big data Analytics, Big data surveillance;</h1>
        <h2>Big data Analytics: </h2>
        <p>a. Integrate:Big data brings together data from many disparate sources and applications. Traditional data integration mechanisms, such as ETL (extract, transform, and load) generally aren’t up to the task. It requires new strategies and technologies to analyze big data sets at terabyte, or even petabyte, scale. During integration, you need to bring in the data, process it, and make sure it’s formatted and available in a form that your business analysts can get started with.

        b. Manage: Big data requires storage. Your storage solution can be in the cloud, on premises, or both. You can store your data in any form you want and bring your desired processing requirements and necessary process engines to those data sets on an on-demand basis. Many people choose their storage solution according to where their data is currently residing. The cloud is gradually gaining popularity because it supports your current compute requirements and enables you to spin up resources as needed.
        c. Analyze: Your investment in big data pays off when you analyze and act on your data. Get new clarity with a visual analysis of your varied data sets. Explore the data further to make new discoveries. Share your findings with others. Build data models with machine learning and artificial intelligence. Put your data to work.</p>
        <h2>Big data surveillance:</h2>
        <p>In the world of big data surveillance, huge amounts of data are sucked into systems that store, combine and analyze them, to create patterns and reveal trends that can be used for Security, Marketing and Governance. Example: Big data surveillance: The case of policing</p>

        <h1>The philosophy of big data</h1>
        <p>Abstract—Big data is growing as an area of information technology, service, and science, and so too is the need for its intellectual understanding and interpretation from a theoretical, philosophical, and societal perspective. The Philosophy of Big Data is the branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of big data; the definitions, meaning, conceptualization, knowledge possibilities, truth standards, and practices in situations involving very-large data sets that are big in volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and variability. The Philosophy of Big Data is evolving into a discipline at two levels, one internal to the field as a generalized articulation of the concepts, theory, and systems that comprise the overall conduct of big data science. The other is external to the field; as a consideration of the impact of big data science more broadly on individuals, society, and the world. Methods, tools, and concepts are evaluated at both the level of industry practice theory and social impact. Three aspects are considered: what might constitute a Philosophy of Big Data, how the disciplines of the Philosophy of Information and the Philosophy of Big Data are developing, and an example of the Philosophy of Big Data in application in the data-intensive science field of Synthetic Biology. Overall a Philosophy of Big Data might helpful in conceptualizing and realizing big data science as a service practice, and also in transitioning to data-rich futures with human and data entities more productively co-existing in mutual growth and collaboration. </p>
        <h2>Quote: “The Philosophy of Information is a completely new development with a capacity to revolutionize philosophy and human interactions with science, technology, data, and reality” - Luciano Floridi, Philosophy of Information, Oxford </h2>
        <p>Definition about philosophy of big data: WHAT IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF BIG DATA? The Philosophy of Big Data is concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of big data; the definitions, meaning, conceptualization, knowledge possibilities, truth standards, and practices in situations involving high-volume, high-velocity, high-variety data sets. Now having considered Information, and the Philosophy of Information, the current status of the disciple of the Philosophy of Big Data can be considered directly. The Philosophy of Big Data is emerging as a specific and distinct field. At least two journals have been founded in the last few years, Big Data & Society: Critical Interdisciplinary Inquiries, and Big Data. Jim Harris, a data science consultant and blogger, has cited the need for data philosophers: “Despite the fact that all we hear about is the need for data scientists, there is also a need for data philosophers”. A productive symbiotic relationship between big data scientists and philosophers is necessary for the development of the field. He references Kant’s idea that perception without conception is blind, and that conception without perception is empty. Different kinds of blindness, conceptual and perceptual, should be investigated in big data science, for example avoiding the case of data fundamentalism, which is blindly believing in big data results.</p>

        <h1>How does big data impact people’s life? Why big data has much powerful capability for the social and individual?</h1>
        <h2>Big data affects organizations across practically every industry. See how each industry can benefit from this onslaught of information</h2>
        <p>Banking: With large amounts of information streaming in from countless sources, banks are faced with finding new and innovative ways to manage big data. While it’s important to understand customers and boost their satisfaction, it’s equally important to minimize risk and fraud while maintaining regulatory compliance. Big data brings big insights, but it also requires financial institutions to stay one step ahead of the game with advanced analytics. 
        Education: Educators armed with data-driven insight can make a significant impact on school systems, students and curriculums. By analyzing big data, they can identify at-risk students, make sure students are making adequate progress, and can implement a better system for evaluation and support of teachers and principals.

        Government: When government agencies are able to harness and apply analytics to their big data, they gain significant ground when it comes to managing utilities, running agencies, dealing with traffic congestion or preventing crime. But while there are many advantages to big data, governments must also address issues of transparency and privacy. 
        Health Care: Patient records. Treatment plans. Prescription information. When it comes to health care, everything needs to be done quickly, accurately – and, in some cases, with enough transparency to satisfy stringent industry regulations. When big data is managed effectively, health care providers can uncover hidden insights that improve patient care. 
        Manufacturing:Armed with insight that big data can provide, manufacturers can boost quality and output while minimizing waste – processes that are key in today’s highly competitive market. More and more manufacturers are working in an analytics-based culture, which means they can solve problems faster and make more agile business decisions. 
        Retail: Customer relationship building is critical to the retail industry – and the best way to manage that is to manage big data. Retailers need to know the best way to market to customers, the most effective way to handle transactions, and the most strategic way to bring back lapsed business. Big data remains at the heart of all those things.
</p>
        
        <h2>If you use a smartphone or social media, it determines a great deal of what you watch, read, listen to and more. Besides, big data permeates all aspects of modern life, too. From health services to traffic, it is everywhere. Let’s delve into some examples of data in everyday life below.</h2>    
        <p>Example:The Big Data Impact on Consumers When shopping online, retailers and advertisers pull on big data to target you with deals and suggested items. These are based on your purchasing or browsing history or a combination of both. For example, Amazon tracks what you’ve bought and looked at, then compares this data with what other users have viewed or purchased. Together, it surfaces up items you’re likely to buy.
The big data impact on consumers isn’t limited to shopping online. Loyalty programs provide brick-and-mortar stores with rich data on what people are buying. Enough so to build a profile based on your purchasing habits. This often results in ads, discounts and other promotions that the retailer has personalized for you.
How Data Impacts Music Streaming
Data analysis in everyday life allows everyone to have their own, personal radio stations. Music streaming services collect both crowdsourced user feedback (in the form of liking/disliking a track). Also, they collect data pulled from their libraries (like Pandora’s Music Genome Project) to algorithmically curate playlists and stations for each individual user. Spotify took this a step further by offering each user a personalized weekly playlist, whose thumbnail is emblazoned with the user’s photo.
Data Designs the Shows You Watch
Here’s why Netflix shows are so addictive: they’re designed from the ground up based on viewers’ watching habits. Leveraging customer data, Netflix identifies the most popular genres, concepts, actors and more. The streaming giant then uses predictive modelling to pool these disparate elements together into a show idea.
But it’s not just about the production of shows and movies. When you browse, Netflix will provide a rating for each title based on whether it thinks you’ll liked it or not. How do they know? By tapping into big data.
Big Data Fights Crime
How does big data impact your life? Sometimes the benefit is invisible and taken for granted. Crime-fighting is such an example.
While we’re not quite at the level of predictive policing seen in Hollywood’s Minority Report, big data does help police each day determine where and when crime is likely to occur next. This helps your local police force decide where to station officers at any given time. Thanks to big data, our streets are a bit safer with less wasted resources.
The Big Data Impact on Health Services
Some of the most beneficial examples of data in everyday life lies in the health sector. One way is through the digitizing of medical records, which en masse helps medical professionals determine which treatments are effective or not for a given ailment. The spread of disease may also be tracked quickly this way.
Next, many people make use of “quantified self” apps that track sleep patterns, heartbeat rates, distance walked and other health and fitness metrics. DNA testing services like 23andMe leverage big data to determine customers’ ethnicity as well as which ailments they may be genetically predisposed to.
Big Data Gets You Where You Need to Be on Time
The reason why you’re able to get to work on time is because of big data. Numerous real-time data metrics go into ensuring traffic runs smoothly, including:
	•	GPS systems (including your mobile phone!)
	•	Social media use
	•	Magnetic sensors installing in the road system
Together, this data helps agencies manage the roads by setting traffic light sequences or redirecting bus routes.
Your favorite map app uses similar data to determine the fastest route to your destination, along with an estimated time of arrival. Also, with a calendar app, it might even alert you when you should leave for an appointment based on traffic data.
News and Other Media Consumption
For good or ill, big data determines what news and media will be recommended to you as you browse your newsfeed. For example, services like Facebook and Twitter surface content based on what’s shared or talked about most.
Social media use isn’t important just for determining what news gets attention. In the reporting stage, journalists sometimes use social media data to report a story. For example, you can use Twitter’s advanced search features to collect posts from both a specific time and place. 
Chatbots Analyze Data to Accomplish Everyday Tasks
Perhaps one of the most useful examples of data in everyday life is chatbots. Chatbots leverage big data to provide hyper-personalized services or to help users find the exact information they need. Sometimes before they can even ask for it. Chatbots perform data analysis in everyday life, using sources like conversation history, location history, past purchases and more. Thus, the possibilities are endless because bots can pull from many different databases.
Botmakers further use big data by iterating their bots based on chatbot analytics. So, this means bots get “smarter” and more efficient. All thanks to conversational data supplied by users.</p>
            
        <h2>Big Data Use Cases</h2>
        <h2>Big data can help you address a range of business activities, from customer experience to analytics</h2>
            <h2>Product Development</h2><p>Companies like Netflix and Procter & Gamble use big data to anticipate customer demand. They build predictive models for new products and services by classifying key attributes of past and current products or services and modeling the relationship between those attributes and the commercial success of the offerings. In addition, P&G uses data and analytics from focus groups, social media, test markets, and early store rollouts to plan, produce, and launch new products.
            <h2>Predictive Maintenance</h2><p>Factors that can predict mechanical failures may be deeply buried in structured data, such as the equipment year, make, and model of a machine, as well as in unstructured data that covers millions of log entries, sensor data, error messages, and engine temperature. By analyzing these indications of potential issues before the problems happen, organizations can deploy maintenance more cost effectively and maximize parts and equipment uptime.</p>
<h2>Customer Experience</h2>The race for customers is on. A clearer view of customer experience is more possible now than ever before. Big data enables you to gather data from social media, web visits, call logs, and other data sources to improve the interaction experience and maximize the value delivered. Start delivering personalized offers, reduce customer churn, and handle issues proactively.
<h2>Fraud and Compliance</h2>  When it comes to security, it’s not just a few rogue hackers; you’re up against entire expert teams. Security landscapes and compliance requirements are constantly evolving. Big data helps you identify patterns in data that indicate fraud and aggregate large volumes of information to make regulatory reporting much faster.
<h2>Machine Learning</h2>  Machine learning is a hot topic right now. And data—specifically big data—is one of the reasons why. We are now able to teach machines instead of program them. The availability of big data to train machine-learning models makes that happen.
<h2>Operational Efficiency</h2>  Operational efficiency may not always make the news, but it’s an area in which big data is having the most impact. With big data, you can analyze and assess production, customer feedback and returns, and other factors to reduce outages and anticipate future demands. Big data can also be used to improve decision-making in line with current market demand.
<h2>Drive Innovation</h2> <p>Big data can help you innovate by studying interdependencies between humans, institutions, entities, and process and then determining new ways to use those insights. Use data insights to improve decisions about financial and planning considerations. Examine trends and what customers want to deliver new products and services. Implement dynamic pricing. There are endless possibilities.</p>
            
        <h2>What is the impact of big data in the world? Why big data has much powerful capability for the social and individual?</h2>
        <p>It’s important to remember that the primary value from big data comes not from the data in its raw form, but from the processing and analysis of it and the insights, products, and services that emerge from analysis. The sweeping changes in big data technologies and management approaches need to be accompanied by similarly dramatic shifts in how data supports decisions and product/service innovation. Also, Big data – and the way organizations manage and derive insight from it – is changing the way the world uses the information of business, social life, even private information.Therefore, Big data has much powerful capability for the organization or individual.</p>
        <p> Example: How big data works:Before discovering how big data can work for your business, you should first understand where it comes from. The sources for big data generally fall into one of three categories:</p>
            
        <h2>Streaming data </h2>
        <p>This category includes data that reaches your IT systems from a web of connected devices, often part of the IoT. You can analyze this data as it arrives and make decisions on what data to keep, what not to keep and what requires further analysis.</p>
        <h2>Social media data </h2>
        <p>The data on social interactions is an increasingly attractive set of information, particularly for marketing, sales and support functions. It's often in unstructured or semistructured forms, so it poses a unique challenge when it comes to consumption and analysis.</p>
        <h2>Publicly available sources </h2>
        <p>Massive amounts of data are available through open data sources like the US government’s data.gov, the CIA World Factbook or the European Union Open Data Portal.</p>

        <h1>Debate: From positive and negative aspects</h1>
        <div class="positive">
        <h2>Positive effects of big data:</h2>
        <h3>1. Dialogue with consumers:</h3>
        <p>Today’s consumers are a tough nut to crack. They look around a lot before they buy, talk to their entire social network about their purchases, demand to be treated as unique and want to be sincerely thanked for buying your products. Big Data allows you to profile these increasingly vocal and fickle little ‘tyrants’ in a far-reaching manner so that you can engage in an almost one-on-one, real-time conversation with them. This is not actually a luxury. If you don’t treat them like they want to, they will leave you in the blink of an eye.</p>
        <p>Just a small example: when any customer enters a bank, Big Data tools allow the clerk to check his/her profile in real-time and learn which relevant products or services (s)he might advise. Big Data will also have a key role to play in uniting the digital and physical shopping spheres: a retailer could suggest an offer on a mobile carrier, on the basis of a consumer indicating a certain need in the social media.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Re-develop your products: </h3>
        <p>Big Data can also help you understand how others perceive your products so that you can adapt them, or your marketing, if need be. Analysis of unstructured social media text allows you to uncover the sentiments of your customers and even segment those in different geographical locations or among different demographic groups.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Big Data lets you test thousands of different variations of computer-aided designs in the blink of an eye so that you can check how minor changes in, for instance, material affect costs, lead times and performance. You can then raise the efficiency of the production process accordingly.</p>
            
        <h3>Perform risk analysis:</h3>
        <p>Success not only depends on how you run your company. Social and economic factors are crucial for your accomplishments as well.  Predictive analytics, fueled by Big Data allows you to scan and analyze newspaper reports or social media feeds so that you permanently keep up to speed on the latest developments in your industry and its environment. Detailed health-tests on your suppliers and customers are another goodie that comes with Big Data. This will allow you to take action when one of them is in risk of defaulting.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Keeping your data safe: </h3>
        <p>You can map the entire data landscape across your company with Big Data tools, thus allowing you to analyze the threats that you face internally. You will be able to detect potentially sensitive information that is not protected in an appropriate manner and make sure it is stored according to regulatory requirements. With real-time Big Data analytics you can, for example, flag up any situation where 16 digit numbers – potentially credit card data - are stored or emailed out and investigate accordingly.</p>
            
        <h3>5. Create new revenue streams: </h3>
        <p>The insights that you gain from analyzing your market and its consumers with Big Data are not just valuable to you. You could sell them as non-personalized trend data to large industry players operating in the same segment as you and create a whole new revenue stream.</p>
        <p>One of the more impressive examples comes from Shazam, the song identification application. It helps record labels find out where music sub-cultures are arising by monitoring the use of its service, including the location data that mobile devices so conveniently provide. The record labels can then find and sign up promising new artists or remarket their existing ones accordingly.</p>
            
        <h3>6. Customize your website in real time: </h3>
        <p>Big Data analytics allows you to personalize the content or look and feel of your website in real time to suit each consumer entering your website, depending on, for instance, their sex, nationality or from where they ended up on your site. The best-known example is probably offering tailored recommendations: Amazon’s use of real-time, item-based, collaborative filtering (IBCF) to fuel its ‛Frequently bought together’ and ‛Customers who bought this item also bought’ features or LinkedIn suggesting ‛People you may know’ or ‛Companies you may want to follow’. And the approach works: Amazon generates about 20% more revenue via this method.</p>
            
        <h3>7. Reducing maintenance costs: </h3>
        <p>Traditionally, factories estimate that a certain type of equipment is likely to wear out after so many years. Consequently, they replace every piece of that technology within that many years, even devices that have much more useful life left in them. Big Data tools do away with such unpractical and costly averages. The massive amounts of data that they access and use and their unequalled speed can spot failing grid devices and predict when they will give out. The result: a much more cost-effective replacement strategy for the utility and less downtime, as faulty devices are tracked a lot faster.</p>
        
        <h3>8. Offering tailored healthcare:</h3>
        <p>We are living in a hyper-personalized world, but healthcare seems to be one of the last sectors still using generalized approaches. When someone is diagnosed with cancer they usually undergo one therapy, and if that doesn’t work, the doctors try another, etc. But what if a cancer patient could receive medication that is tailored to his individual genes? This would result in a better outcome, less cost, less frustration and less fear.</p>
        <p>With human genome mapping and Big Data tools, it will soon be commonplace for everyone to have their genes mapped as part of their medical record. This brings medicine closer than ever to finding the genetic determinants that cause a disease and developing drugs expressly tailored to treat those causes — in other words, personalized medicine.</p>
            
        <h3>9. Offering enterprise-wide insights:</h3>
        <p>Previously, if business users needed to analyze large amounts of varied data, they had to ask their IT colleagues for help as they themselves lacked the technical skills for doing so. Often, by the time they received the requested information, it was no longer useful or even correct. With Big Data tools, the technical teams can do the groundwork and then build repeatability into algorithms for faster searches. In other words, they can develop systems and install interactive and dynamic visualization tools that allow business users to analyze, view and benefit from the data.</p>
            
        <h3>10. Making our cities smarter: </h3>
        <p>To help them deal with the consequences of their fast expansion, an increasing number of smart cities are indeed leveraging Big Data tools for the benefit of their citizens and the environment. The city of Oslo in Norway, for instance, reduced street lighting energy consumption by 62% with a smart solution. Since the Memphis Police Department started using predictive software in 2006, it has been able to reduce serious crime by 30 %. The city of Portland, Oregon, used technology to optimize the timing of its traffic signals and was able to eliminate more than 157,000 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions in just six years – the equivalent of taking 30,000 passenger vehicles off the roads for an entire year. The smart city project of Rivas Vaciamadrid in Spain – Ecopolis –  has realized energy savings of 35% and a 50% reduction in ICT spending through a winning combination of smart  grid and energy management, access control, air quality monitoring, traffic management, IPTV, etc. And those are just a few of the most spectacular examples.</p>
        </div>   
        
        <div class="negative">
        <h2>Negative effects of big data:</h2>
        <p>1. It’s harmless -- until data falls into the wrong (powerful) hands: Hackers, since they can store data as long as they want, may choose not do anything with those stolen social security numbers until years after the actual theft. Whether it’s from the breaches of various consumer services and retailers, compromised personal information lives outside the watch of the organizations we originally shared it with, ready to be put to use at any moment. Even if the hacked organization provides you with credit monitoring and identity theft insurance after the fact, your data is still out there. You could see the consequences immediately, or 40 years from now.</p>
        
        <p>2. It incentivizes more collection of data and longer retention of it. If any and all data sets might turn out to prove useful for discovering some obscure but valuable correlation, you might as well collect it and hold on to it. In long run, the more useful big data proves to be, the stronger this incentivizing effect will be—but in the short run it almost doesn’t matter; the current buzz over the idea is enough to do the trick.</p>
        
        <p>3. When you combine someone’s personal information with vast external data sets, you can infer new facts about that person (such as the fact that they’re pregnant, or are showing early signs of Parkinson’s disease, or are unconsciously drawn toward products that are colored red or purple). And when it comes to such facts, a person a) might not want the data owner to know b) might not want anyone to know c) might not even know themselves. The fact is, humans like to control what other people do and do not know about them—that’s the core of what privacy is, and data mining threatens to violate that principle.</p>
            
        <P>4. Many (perhaps most) people are not aware of how much information is being collected (for example, that stores are tracking their purchases over time), let alone how it is being used (scrutinized for insights into their lives).  The fact that Target goes to considerable trouble to hide its knowledge from its customers tells you all you need to know on that front.</P>
            
        <p>5. Big data can further tilt the playing field toward big institutions and away from individuals. In economic terms, it accentuates the information asymmetries of big companies over other economic actors and allows for people to be manipulated. If a store can gain insight into just how badly I want to buy something, just how much I can afford to pay for it, just how knowledgeable I am about the marketplace, or the best way to scare me into buying it, it can extract the maximum profit from me.</p>
        
        <p>6. It holds the potential to accentuate power differentials among individuals in society by amplifying existing advantages and disadvantages. Those who are savvy and well educated may get improved treatment from companies and government – while those who are poor, underprivileged, and perhaps already have some strikes against them in life (such as a criminal record) will be easily identified, and treated worse. In that way data mining may increase social stratification.</p>
            
        <p>7. Data mining can be used for so-called “risk analysis” in ways that treat people unfairly and often capriciously—for example, by insurance companies or banks to approve or deny applications. Credit card companies sometimes lower a customer’s credit limitbased on the repayment history of the other customers of stores where a person shops. Such “behavioral scoring” is a form of economic guilt-by-association based on making statistical inferences about a person that go far beyond anything that person can control or be aware of.</p>
        
        <p>8. Its use by law enforcement raises even sharper issues—and when our national security agencies start using it to try to spot terrorists, those stakes can get even more serious. We know too little about how our security agencies are using Big Data, but such approaches have been discussed since the days of the Total Information Awareness program and before—and there is strong evidence that it’s being used by the NSA to sift through the vast volumes of communications that agency collects.  The threat here is that people will be tagged and suffer adverse consequences without due process, the ability to fight back, or even knowledge that they have been discriminated against. The threat of bad effects is magnified by the fact that data mining is so ineffectiveat spotting true terrorists.</p>
        
        <p>9. Over time such consequences will lead to chilling effects, as people become more reluctant to engage in any behaviors that will put them under the macroscope (more about that in a future post).</p>

        <h1>Conclusion: Why big data is important to people? And what’s the future tendency of big data?</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2>Why big data is important to people? </h2>
        <p>Here is example about big data is very important to company or finical organization.The importance of big data does not revolve around how much data a company has but how a company utilises the collected data. Every company uses data in its own way; the more efficiently a company uses its data, the more potential it has to grow. The company can take data from any source and analyse it to find answers which will enable:</p>
        <p>Cost Savings : Some tools of Big Data like Hadoop and Cloud-Based Analytics can bring cost advantages to business when large amounts of data are to be stored and these tools also help in identifying more efficient ways of doing business.</p>
        <p>Time Reductions :The high speed of tools like Hadoop and in-memory analytics can easily identify new sources of data which helps businesses analyzing data immediately and make quick decisions based on the learnings.</p>
        <p>New Product Development : By knowing the trends of customer needs and satisfaction through analytics you can create products according to the wants of customers.</p>
        <p>Understand the market conditions : By analyzing big data you can get a better understanding of current market conditions. For example, by analyzing customers’ purchasing behaviors, a company can find out the products that are sold the most and produce products according to this trend. By this, it can get ahead of its competitors.</p>
        <p>Control online reputation: Big data tools can do sentiment analysis. Therefore, you can get feedback about who is saying what about your company. If you want to monitor and improve the online presence of your business, then, big data tools can help in all this.</p>
        </div>
            
        <div>
        <h1>What’s the future tendency of big data? </h1>
        <p>Big Data innovations have been consistently increasing over the time. With every year there is improvement in the sector. When we consider 2016 for the data innovations, it was a time for big data as during that period the storing, processing, and extracting value from data of all forms and sizes was applicable. Moving ahead that is in 2017 the systems which support large volumes of both structured and unstructured data continued to increase at a rapid pace. Now is the time when the market requires platforms that help data custodians govern and secure big data while allowing the final users to go for the evaluation of the data. Thus we can say that with time systems are getting enhanced according to the prior IT standards.</p>
        
        <p>Moving to the Cloud has increased: It is quite a surprising element that companies have observed the crowd moving to the cloud in great numbers. There were initial issues regarding this but now, later on, it was realized that cloud is relatively safer than anything which other companies offer.It is also observed that a great number of employees are working isolatedly meaning there has been a requirement to give secure access to data and analytical tools from anywhere they are in the world, making Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) increasingly important. </p>
        
        <p>Growth to be continued in real sense: As stated by the "Streaming Analytics Market by Verticals - Worldwide Market Forecast & Analysis (2015 - 2020)" report, real-time analytics were predicted to observe an average annual growth of 31.3% between 2015 and 2020, which seems like it is still moving on in the present scenario. Earlier things which were seen as a practice for the big and rich companies have now become quite common among SMEs. All this is the result of the popularity of the technology and decreasing of the cost. A number of companies will be looking into memory and in chip, approaches to collect and evaluate the data as fast as they can. This is done so that competitors use such technology and once it prevails in market people will be forced to use this.</p>
        
        <p>Big Data to be finished: The term 'big data' will quietly go away from the world of IT. Though its something which has a broad meaning, but by itself, it is actually meaningless. Like IT, big data is a term which includes a lot in the minds of people to really have an exact meaning beyond saying to people who know just a little to explain that 'I work in big data'. There are a great number of elements which are categorized under big data from machine learning and data collection, to analytics and data security, none of which really have to anything to do with each other, but are still categorized as 'big data'.  Even you will find that groups who do not have any kind of relation with big data are also being aware of these zone. The reasons behind this are the hacks, robotics, self-driving cars, and myriad other data-driven technologies From this we can clearly evaluate the use of term big data is not going to be out anytime soon.</p>
            
        <p>4. Hacks to get more vast: It is rightly quoted by Benjamin Franklin that 'In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes', but in 2018 we can add 'and huge hacks will impact companies'. In the last three years, 8 of the top 10 hacks have already taken place which is actually not a coincidence.  You might observe that Data security is getting better but the improvement in data security is working almost parallel with the enhanced skill of those who are further working to grab it. We can actually relate hacks going up with the increasing amount of data. More is the data, more will be the hacks happening. Taking the true scale of Uber hacks and its coverup which are yet opened but the statement made it clear that around 57 million accounts were cleft and the company had to pay $100,000 to keep the hackers quiet and maintain the secrecy in the market. This scenario is turning like a fear which is making the things go more worse. The reason behind this as stated before is that more data is collected and the companies are forced to pay more to the hackers to get their data unlock or stop it from being disclosed. As a research was carried on from Symantec, there has been a 266% spike in the amount compensated by companies to the hackers who spoiled them with ransomware as compared to 2016. At the same time, there are very rare people who are arrested for hacking.  If there is going to be an increase in the reward given for hacking and a very little chance of being caught than the people will take it as an opportunity and will try practicing this activity more often.</p>
